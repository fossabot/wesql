Basic insert, update, delete from Master->Slave
DBUG code will set + check transfer of extra
row data in RBR
**** On Master ****
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);
Ten inserts in one transaction -> 1 epoch transaction
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10);
COMMIT;
Wait for Binlog-on-disk
flush logs;
Check that we have the expected extra row data in the Binlog
create table raw_data(txt varchar(1000));
select replace(txt, '\r', '') from raw_data where txt like '%### Extra row ndb info: data_format:%' order by txt;
replace(txt, '\r', '')
drop table raw_data;
Generate some more insert, update, delete traffic
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT a+10 FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT a+20 FROM t1;
INSERT INTO t1 SELECT a+40 FROM t1;
UPDATE t1 SET a = a+1;
UPDATE t1 SET a = a+1;
UPDATE t1 SET a = a+1;
UPDATE t1 SET a = a+1;
UPDATE t1 SET a = a+1;
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a > 390;
**** On Slave ****

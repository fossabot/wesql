# This validates the fix for Issue #144.  The problem was that with more
# than one client accessing/deleting the same row there was a possibility
# of client A finding a row (through Next() or Prev()) but the row being
# deleted before the GetForUpdate() call could occur.  When this happened
# a nearly useless error was being returned.

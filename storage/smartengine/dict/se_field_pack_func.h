/*
  Pack the data with Variable-Length Space-Padded Encoding.

  The encoding is there to meet two goals:

  Goal#1. Comparison. The SQL standard says

    " If the collation for the comparison has the PAD SPACE characteristic,
    for the purposes of the comparison, the shorter value is effectively
    extended to the length of the longer by concatenation of <space>s on the
    right.

  At the moment, all MySQL collations except one have the PAD SPACE
  characteristic.  The exception is the "binary" collation that is used by
  [VAR]BINARY columns. (Note that binary collations for specific charsets,
  like utf8_bin or latin1_bin are not the same as "binary" collation, they have
  the PAD SPACE characteristic).

  Goal#2 is to preserve the number of trailing spaces in the original value.

  This is achieved by using the following encoding:
  The key part:
  - Stores mem-comparable image of the column
  - It is stored in chunks of fpi->m_segment_size bytes (*)
    = If the remainder of the chunk is not occupied, it is padded with mem-
      comparable image of the space character (cs->pad_char to be precise).
  - The last byte of the chunk shows how the rest of column's mem-comparable
    image would compare to mem-comparable image of the column extended with
    spaces. There are three possible values.
     - VARCHAR_CMP_LESS_THAN_SPACES,
     - VARCHAR_CMP_EQUAL_TO_SPACES
     - VARCHAR_CMP_GREATER_THAN_SPACES

  VARCHAR_CMP_EQUAL_TO_SPACES means that this chunk is the last one (the rest
  is spaces, or something that sorts as spaces, so there is no reason to store
  it).

  Example: if fpi->m_segment_size=5, and the collation is latin1_bin:

   'abcd\0'   => [ 'abcd' <VARCHAR_CMP_LESS> ]['\0    ' <VARCHAR_CMP_EQUAL> ]
   'abcd'     => [ 'abcd' <VARCHAR_CMP_EQUAL>]
   'abcd   '  => [ 'abcd' <VARCHAR_CMP_EQUAL>]
   'abcdZZZZ' => [ 'abcd' <VARCHAR_CMP_GREATER>][ 'ZZZZ' <VARCHAR_CMP_EQUAL>]

  As mentioned above, the last chunk is padded with mem-comparable images of
  cs->pad_char. It can be 1-byte long (latin1), 2 (utf8_bin), 3 (utf8mb4), etc.

  fpi->m_segment_size depends on the used collation. It is chosen to be such
  that no mem-comparable image of space will ever stretch across the segments
  (see get_segment_size_from_collation).

  == The value part (aka unpack_info) ==
  The value part stores the number of space characters that one needs to add
  when unpacking the string.
  - If the number is positive, it means add this many spaces at the end
  - If the number is negative, it means padding has added extra spaces which
    must be removed.

  Storage considerations
  - depending on column's max size, the number may occupy 1 or 2 bytes
  - the number of spaces that need to be removed is not more than
    SE_TRIMMED_CHARS_OFFSET=8, so we offset the number by that value and
    then store it as unsigned.
